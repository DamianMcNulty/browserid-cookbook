# Persona Cookbook #
This repo is for demonstrating how to use Persona in your favorite
language or framework.

In most cases though, you can probably find a [library or plugin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Persona/Libraries_and_plugins) ready
to use with the framework or CMS that your site is built on.
